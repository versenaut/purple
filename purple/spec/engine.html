That's really it. Of course, there is plenty of complexity hiding behind those words. Below are further
details about these two areas.

><P
>&#13;Plug-ins will physically reside, in compiled form, somewhere on the same machine that runs the Purple engine. They
will be compiled into shared objects (<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"DLL"</SPAN
> in Windows) that can be loaded under program control by the
engine client executable.
</P
><P
>&#13;In the simplest form, the engine inspects the disk location where plug-ins are held once, as it starts up. For each
found file, it tries to validate it as actually being a Purple plug-in, and if it seems to be, issues a call to the
<TT
CLASS="function"
>init()</TT
> entry point. A slightly more advanced approach, possible as a future enhancement, would be for the engine to
continually monitor the plug-in location, and load/unload plug-ins as they appear/disappear. This would make the
development of plug-ins more dynamic since the engine would not need to be restarted with each new version of one of
its plug-ins.
</P
><P
>&#13;In the <TT
CLASS="function"
>init()</TT
> code, the plug-in uses the various init-type functions in the Purple API to register information about
itself, like which inputs it has and general meta information about author, help text, and so on. The engine, in
which the API is implemented, records the information. When the <TT
CLASS="function"
>init()</TT
> function is done, control returns to the
engine proper which can then inspect the recorded information, and convert it into a plug-in description which is
exported as XML in a Verse text node.

>Graph Editing</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;The engine, being a Verse client, will have a object node associated with it on the Verse host. Verse object
nodes can contain method groups that in turn contain methods, which are named procedure-like entry points that can
accepts calls with a set of parameters. Such methods have <A
HREF="comms.html#comms-methods"
>been chosen</A
> as the
interface to use to edit Purple module graphs.
</P
><P
>&#13;The engine will expose a method group with some standardized name, like <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="literal"
>purple</TT
>"</SPAN
> so
that the UI client can recognize the engine for what it is. This group will contain all Purple-specific methods,
split into two sub-groups by the use of a simple naming convention: methods that create and destroy whole graphs
have a <TT
CLASS="literal"
>graph_</TT
> name prefix, while module editing calls are prefixed by <TT
CLASS="literal"
>module_</TT
>.
</P
><P
>&#13;Typically, a call to one of these methods will result in some change to the engine's internal data structures
that represent the set of existing graphs. This change will then be made externally visible by the engine
changing the corresponding <A
HREF="comms.html#comms-graphs"
>XML descriptions</A
>.
</P
><P
>&#13;Setting the input of a module is a special case, since doing so updates not only the graph description, but
also causes the module itself to be re-run, which in turn can change the inputs of any modules connected to
it, thus triggering a cascade of re-computations.

>&#13;Computation in Purple is based solely on a data flow model. Modules are assumed to depend only on their inputs;
it is not valid to write a plug-in with i.e. an internal dependency on time or some other <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"global"</SPAN
>
input. The root cause for re-computation of a module's output value is a change of one of its inputs, or a change
of the output connection (a module whose output is not connected to anything need never have its value computed).
</P
><P
>&#13;Although plug-ins are written in C, a very imperative language, plug-ins as a whole do not have side-effects;
the only externally visible result of running a module is whatever set of values appear on its output. Thus,
plug-ins can be seen as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"functions"</SPAN
> in an imaginary functional language. Since functions in such
languages cannot have side-effects, it is simple to optimize out re-computations based on knowledge of the
in- and output connections.
</P
><P
>&#13;Probably, the Purple engine will not internally buffer any values of modules, since doing so can be very
expensive in terms of memory (it is possible for a module's output value to be a collection of possibly
hundreds of full Verse nodes). Rather, it will make the module <TT
CLASS="function"
>compute()</TT
> the output value whenever it is
needed.
