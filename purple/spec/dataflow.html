>&#13;Purple is about connecting modules so that interesting data can flow, so a few words about the actual flow
of data are needed. To help the discussion, consider the following figure which shows a pair of modules
communicating:

Seen here is a little graph consisting of two modules; one instance of a plug-in named <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Sphere"</SPAN
>,
connected to an instance of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Bend"</SPAN
>.
</P
><P
>&#13;The Sphere module has two inputs, labeled <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"radius"</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"splits"</SPAN
>. The radius is a real
number, while the splits is an unsigned integer. The intent is that the module emits a mesh representation of a
sphere, with the given radius and number of splits in the longitudinal and latitudinal directions. The plug-in
simply creates the needed geometry node, computes the required vertex positions, creates the vertices, and finally
connects them into a polygonal mesh. This mesh then appears on the output.
</P
><P
>&#13;The Bend module has a single input labeled <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"geometry"</SPAN
>. The plug-in will take any geometry it can
find on its input, apply some kind of (here hard coded, in a more realistic case it would take additional inputs
to control the amount and direction of the bend) bending transform on the vertices of the geometry. The bent
geometry then appears on the output.
</P
><P
>&#13;Here, the final data would not end up on the Verse host, since the output of the Bend module is not connected
to anything. It would require explicit action from the user, probably by connecting the output to some kind of
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Verse data sink"</SPAN
> module, to make the Purple engine write it to the host. Exactly how this will
work has not yet been decided.
</P
><P
>&#13;As the above example indicates, the data that flows on the lines between modules is not very limited in type;
it's perfectly okay for a module to emit a single integer, or a full geometry node with (potentially) thousands
of values in it, or even ten such nodes. The plug-in code that actually gets the value from each input does so
with a very specific type as part of the request, however, and this is when the Purple engine looks on the incoming
data and extracts a value of the requested type. Exactly how this is done, how for instance a geometry node is
converted to a string, will need to be detailed elsewhere. The general idea is to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"pick"</SPAN
> a suitable
value, not to do very heavy conversions. So in the geometry node-as-string case, the node name would probably be
returned.

>&#13;The example above pictures a module, Sphere, that acts as a data creation point, or source: the code in the
corresponding plug-in actually <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>creates</I
> new geometry data from scratch, using built-in
hard-coded <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"knowledge"</SPAN
> of what is to be created, and letting a couple of parameters control the
process. While this is a useful paradigm, it is also very desirable to be able to connect Purple modules to
<I
CLASS="emphasis"

> data in order to modify what has already been created.

>&#13;Verse data is accessed through the use of a built-in <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>input plug-in</I
>. This plug-in is
kind of magical, in that it is not possible to use the Purple API to implement the same functionality.
The plug-in takes as an input a string, that names the target node. It outputs the named node, or nothing
if no such node exists.
</P
><P
>&#13;This is, admittedly, a rather limited way of getting node data into a plug-in. We have visions for far
grander schemes (including a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"filter API"</SPAN
> with which custom input plug-ins could be written)
but chose to limit it to something small yet useful to simplify implementation of the system.

is given the constant string <TT
CLASS="literal"
>"foo"</TT
>, and will emit on its output either the node named
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"foo"</SPAN
> or nothing. The Bend module that comes next is then given this node to operate upon (it
is probably a good idea to pass the name of a geometry node to the Input module).

></H3
><P
>&#13;As its name suggests, the Output plug-in is used to send data <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"out"</SPAN
>, as in back to Verse. It is
the counterpart of the Input plug-in, and is used to make the results of a Purple graph visible, by sending
the data to a Verse server.
</P
><P
>&#13;Possibly, there needs to be two different varieties of the Output plug-in, or perhaps options to control its
behavior. What is needed is a way to output node data in one of two distinct ways:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Overwrite existing nodes.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Create new nodes.</P
></LI
></UL
>
</P
><P
>&#13;In the former case, a node is simply <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"streamed"</SPAN
> through a graph of modules, that can apply some
kind of effect, add <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"intelligence"</SPAN
>, or whatever. The data needs to replace the original data in
the source node, since the desired effect is simply to modify existing data, not create new.
</P
><P
>&#13;In the latter case, a module graph is used to create new data from existing, perhaps by combining data held
in several nodes into something new and unique. In such a case, it is not possible to replace the original
data, which might not even be of the same format (e.g., stored in a node of the same type as the final output).
</P
><P
>&#13;Data which doesn't flow into an Output module need never be computed, since it by definition cannot be seen
outside the graph in question.
</P

>Self-Modifying Graphs</A
></H3
><P
>&#13;Once we have both the Input and Output plug-ins, it becomes possible to create a loop via the Verse server:
use an Input module to pick out a node, modify it using some general processing module, and then stream it
back to the Verse server using an Output module (in replace-mode). The changes done then come back to the
Purple engine, which will notice that the node in question is being monitored by an Input module, and re-run
the graph in question, thus triggering another iteration. This loop is then infinite, and the Purple engine
will spend all of its time doing the update, probably destroying the original data in the process of trying
to apply an infinite amount of processing.
</P
><P
>&#13;The way we intend to handle this situation is like this: whenever a graph ends up saying that a node depends
on itself, the node will be automatically copied behind the scenes by Purple, and the node will then be made
to depend on the copy. So, if you say <TT
CLASS="literal"
>foo := scale(foo, 2.0)</TT
> Purple will actually do something
more along the lines of <TT
CLASS="literal"
>bar := copy(foo); foo = scale(bar, 2.0)</TT
>.
</P
><P
>&#13;This copying procedure prevents the loop from forming, and thus solves the problem. It is not clear at the moment
how it will handle more complicated cases when several nodes flow in between modules, but the theory should be
expandable.
