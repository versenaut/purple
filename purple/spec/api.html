>4. The Plug-In API</H1
><P
>&#13;The plug-in API is used to implement plug-ins, that are to be loaded and run by the engine. Plug-ins are written
by developers, and have full freedom to manipulate Verse data. Plug-ins follow a simple template with two publicly
visible functions, and use functions from the API to describe themselves and get things done.

><P
>&#13;It is the responsibility of the <TT

> function to register the plug-in with the engine. It does this by
calling various functions in the <A
HREF="api.html#api-init"

> of the API. Typically, the
function will do:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P

will be inherited by all entry points.</P

entry point.
</P

data it must say so by registering inputs.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Set meta information. This includes the plug-in's name, who wrote it, copyright, and various help
and other descriptive texts. All of these are entirely optional, but to make the plug-in accessible for

</P
><P
>&#13;The <TT
CLASS="function"

> does not receive any arguments, and does return any value to the engine. All interaction is
done by calling functions in the init group. Calling functions in other groups has no effect, since the
plug-in has not yet been instantiated (into a module) when <TT

The function need not be externally visible, and thus its name is not necessarily <SPAN

but it is the generic name used throughout this document to refer to a plug-in's main result-generating
function. For a typical plug-in, the steps to take in <TT

<P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Call <TT
CLASS="function"
>p_input_XXX()</TT

inputs. Here, XXX is a type such as <SPAN

is desired.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Do the processing, whatever is required. Perhaps access vertices of input nodes, read pixels from
bitmaps, or whatever. Might also <SPAN

></LI
><LI
><P
>If needed, call a set of simple output functions, like <TT

et cetera. Node data can also be output, and any node data created is output by default.</P

one or more plug-ins with the engine. Each plug-in must be described, it is necessary to provide the engine
at minimum with the <TT

with meta information about author, copyright, purpose, and so on.
</P
><P

<P

><OL

><LI
><P

</P
><P
>&#13;<PRE
CLASS="programlisting"

void p_init_create(const char *name);

This function begins a new plug-in, and registers it with the given name. All the other init-functions act
on the last created plug-in.
</P
><P
>&#13;<PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>/* Register a plug-in input. */
void p_init_input(int index, PInputType type, const char *name, ...);
</PRE

This function adds an input to the plug-in description. The parameters are:
<P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="variablelist"
><DL
><DT
><TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>index</I
></TT

>&#13;The type of the input. This information ends up in the plug-in description text buffer, and is used by
user interfaces to construct suitable controls and manipulators. It does not actually control which kind

interfaces. A sample value might be <TT

recommended. Also, names need not be unique although that, too, is highly recommended. It is possible
that a Purple engine will ignore plug-ins whose inputs are not uniquely named, for instance.

</P
><P
>&#13;The reason the numerical index is included here is to act as a helper when switching between reading the
<TT

>. Having the index visible
in both places should help when matching up the calls.
</P
><P
>&#13;Next, we have:

<PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>/* Register computational callback. */
void p_init_compute(void (*compute)(PPInput *input, PPOutput output));
</PRE
>
This function registers the <TT
CLASS="function"
>compute()</TT
> function used by the engine to calculate the output, or
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>result</I
></SPAN
>, of running the plug-in. It is passed the following arguments:
<P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="variablelist"
><DL
><DT
>input</DT
><DD
><P
>An array of input port descriptors. These are used to read out actual input values,
see API below.</P
></DD
></DL
></DIV
>
</P
><P
>&#13;Finally, there is:
<PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>/* Register meta information about a plug-in. */
void p_init_meta(const char *category, const char *text);
</PRE
>
This function registers <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"meta data"</SPAN
> about the plug-in, using a simple string-based approach.
Meta data is collected into categories, and categories look like path names in a file system (for instance
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"desc/purpose"</SPAN
> should be a short text describing the purpose of the plug-in). The parameters
are:
<P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="variablelist"
><DL
><DT
><TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>category</I
></TT
></DT
><DD
><P

decided upon. Category names are limited to 7-bit ASCII characters.
</P
></DD
><DT
><TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>text</I
></TT

><P

>4.2.2. Input Accessing</H3
><P
>&#13;One conceptual half of this group of functions consists of just a single output-polymorph function. Because
the Purple API is in C, however, where such polymorphism is not supported, the implementation is as a set of
functions:
<PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>/* Retrieve input value. */
boolean p_input_boolean(PPInput port);
int32   p_input_int32(PPInput port);
uint32  p_input_uint32(PPInput port);
real32  p_input_real32(PPInput port);
real64  p_input_real64(PPInput port);
/* More functions... */ 
</PRE
>
These functions simply take PPInput <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"port"</SPAN
> that represents an input, and return the value currently
present there. If a module is connected to the input, it might be asked to <TT
CLASS="function"
>compute()</TT
> the value, or it
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>might</I
></SPAN
> be cached by the Purple engine. If the input is assigned a constant value, it will simply
be returned.
</P
><P
>&#13;The correct <TT
CLASS="varname"
>port</TT
> is found by simply indexing into the <TT
CLASS="varname"
>input</TT
> array
passed to the <TT
CLASS="function"
>compute()</TT
> function, with the index from the init-call that registered the input.
</P
><P
>&#13;The above functions are very straight-forward, but there is also a need for a different input approach, for
the case when node data is being sent between modules. Then, it becomes desirable to be able to ask for
things like <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"all objects from input N"</SPAN
>, which is handled by this function:
<PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>/* Retrieve input nodes. */
const PNodeList * p_input_node(PPInput port, VNodeType mask);
</PRE
>
This function returns a list of <SPAN
CLASS="type"
>const PNode *</SPAN
> pointers, containing the nodes of a given (set of)
type(s) from the data connected to a given input.

NAME="AEN265"

><P
>&#13;Another set of functions that could be represented as a single polymorphic one if the API was implemented in
a slightly more expressive language than C. These set a single value in the output, as opposed to a whole
node.
<PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>/* Simple outputs. */
void p_output_boolean(boolean value);
void p_output_int32(int32 value);
void p_output_uint32(uint32 value);
void p_output_string(const char *value);
/* And so on... */
</PRE
>
</P
><P
>&#13;Nodes are treated somewhat differently. There are two types of nodes in the Purple API: input and output
nodes. Input nodes, represented by <SPAN
CLASS="type"
>const PINode *</SPAN
> pointers, are read-only objects that act
as in-memory representations of the Verse node types. Being read-only, you cannot change any of the data
in an input node. If a plug-in needs to create or change node data, it needs to do so using an output
node, a <SPAN
CLASS="type"
>PONode *</SPAN
> variable.
</P
><P
>&#13;Output nodes are created and sent to the plug-in's output by the same function:
<PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>PONode * p_output_node(const PINode *node);</PRE
>
This will copy the data in the given input node and return an editable representation. It will also
send the output node, in its final state at the end of the <TT
CLASS="function"
>compute()</TT
> function, to the plug-in's output.
</P
><P
>&#13;Note that it is perfectly possible to combine all of the above output-setting functions rather freely;
a plug-in can output both a string and a node, for instance. However, since there are no traversing
functions for getting inputs, the simple types can only be output once. Calling e.g.
<TT
CLASS="function"
>p_output_string()</TT
> twice will overwrite the first string with the second. For
nodes, this does not hold true; all nodes referenced by <TT
CLASS="function"
>p_output_node()</TT
> will
be output.
