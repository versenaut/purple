The most important point here is that there are two actual Verse clients, talking to the same host. One of the
clients, the execution environment (or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"engine"</SPAN
>) is located close to the server, while the other
one (the user interface) is run by actual end users across the Internet.

<P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="variablelist"
><DL
><DT
>engine</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13; Technically a Verse client, but run close to the host (very likely in the same physical location, perhaps
 in the same rack or even on the same machine). Contains a collection of plug-ins, and lets clients connect,
 learn about available plug-ins, and work with them by creating and populating graphs.
 </P
></DD
><DT
>plug-in</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13; A component, or building block. A plug-in is a program, that resides on the same machine as the Purple engine.
 It is loaded by the engine, and made available for use. Technically, plug-ins are shared objects (the Unix
 term for what is called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"dynamically loaded libraries"</SPAN
> (DLLs) in Windows) that are loaded by the
 engine and that describe themselves programmatically. Written using the special high-level Purple API, far
 simpler than writing a stand-alone Verse client. It is possible to define more than one plug-in in a single
 shared object/DLL, for convenience.
 </P

><DT
>graph</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13; Graphs are the canvases that users of Purple work on, the container, document, or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"project"</SPAN
> that
 is the background for all work. All modules belong to a graph. Each user can have several graphs that she works
 on in parallel, just like multiple documents can be open in a word processor.
 </P
></DD
><DT
>module</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13; Modules are <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>instantiated</I
> plug-ins. There can be any number of modules using each plug-in,
 that all reference the same block of functionality. Modules are connected together and collected into graphs,
 see above. The terms <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>node</I
> and <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>vertex</I
>, that are both commonly used to
 refer to parts of graphs, are not being used since the risk of confusion with Verse nodes and Verse geometry
 vertices as deemed to be too high.
