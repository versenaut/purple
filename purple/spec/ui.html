>7. The User Interface</H1
><P
>&#13;The Purple user interface (or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"UI"</SPAN
> for short) is the second of the dedicated Verse clients
needed in the Purple system, the other one being the <A
HREF="engine.html"
>engine</A
>. It is responsible
for letting users access the Purple system and work with it by creating modules, connecting modules to
each other to form graphs (or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"construction histories"</SPAN
> as they are commonly called using a more
user-friendly and specific terminology), assign values to the inputs of modules, and too see the results
of course.
</P
><P
>&#13;The way the user interface client interacts with the other, back-end, half of the Purple system is like this:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;After connecting to a Verse host, it looks for an object node that can be identified as being the avatar of
a Purple engine. If found, this tells the client that the Purple system is available and it can continue. If
not, it should probably notify the user.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Follow the engine object's text node link(s), looking for a text node holding plug-in descriptions. The string
used in the language field for such nodes needs to be documented somewhere, naturally. Probably it will be
something like <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"xml/purple/plug-ins"</SPAN
> or something. This looks like a
<A
HREF="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/"
TARGET="_top"
>MIME type</A
>, but there is no rule that says
Verse text node language strings are MIME types.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;If a matching plug-in text node is found, subscribe to all its buffers, parse then content, and present the
list of available plug-ins to the user. This could be done by populating menus, lists, or other user interface
elements with the data.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Look for text buffers that contain graph descriptions. Again, these would probably be identified by having a
language string of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"xml/purple/graph"</SPAN
> or something similar, and might use tags for additional
information such as ownership (Verse-level node ownership can't be used, since the node will likely be created
and owned by the Purple engine client).
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;For all found graph nodes, subscribe to all buffers and parse them. Let the user pick a graph to view and
edit.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;There must also be a way to create a new graph of course, and to delete and rename existing ones. These
operations will be access-managed by the Purple engine.
</P
></LI

</P
><P
>&#13;There are a few open questions when it comes to the security of what is outlined above.

>7.1. What is Shown?</H2
><P
>&#13;The UI client needs to give the user a view of the data being worked on. This is harder than it sounds,
since there are two aspects to the data: there is the schematic view of modules connecting to each other,
but there will also be a need to have geometric view for most graphs, i.e. the actual Verse geometry (or
other data, such as bitmaps) that is being worked on.
</P
><P
>&#13;This is probably best implemented by letting the user chose between two different full-screen views, either
a passive scene display, perhaps implemented using existing Verse rendering technology, or a Purple
module graph display.
</P
><P
>&#13;As an initial mental model, the UI client will probably most resemble a typical (if there is such a thing)
3D modeling/animation package. The intent is that it should have the same functionality, provided there are
plug-ins available for the required tasks.

>7.2. Setting Inputs</H2
><P
>&#13;An important part of working with Purple is of course the assigning of values to module inputs. This can be
done in two ways: by connecting the output of another module to the input, or by assigning a literal and
direct value to the input.
</P
><P
>&#13;Connecting the output of one module to a module input is probably best done graphically, by some suitable
direct manipulation technique such as clicking and dragging a line from the output of one module to the
input of another. Connecting the output of one module to several module inputs is legal.
</P
><P
>&#13;Assigning literal values to inputs should be done through some kind of graphical interface built on-the-fly
by the UI client, based on the information about plug-in inputs found in the XML description. For instance,
a real-numbered input with a set range could by presented to the user as a slider, labeled with the input name.
The controls could be collected on a panel that dynamically changes with selection/focus, or perhaps even
rendered right on top of the module when it is selected. There are plenty of possibilities for creative design
here.

>7.3. Collapsing Modules</H2
><P
>&#13;One desirable feature for Purple is that users should be able to select a number of interconnected modules
(i.e. a sub-graph) and say <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"I wish this was a plug-in"</SPAN
>. The system should then group the
selected modules, and replace them on screen with a simplified, <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>collapsed</I
></SPAN
>, representation.
This gives end users the powerful tool of encapsulation, letting them simplify often-used constructs into
what looks like a single entity.
</P
><P
>&#13;A collapsed set of modules must have a clearly defined output, since modules can only have one output.

>&#13;It is currently not clear how, technically, collapsing should be implemented. It would be most clean to use
method calls, but the amount of information needed might exceed the capacity of the Verse method call
system. The obvious alternative is then to have the UI client write descriptive XML, but this is a lot less
desirable since it can easily be problematic with multiple concurrent UI clients active.
