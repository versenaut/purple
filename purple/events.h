/* Events that need handling might be:
 * Simple events that don't affect the graphs
 * - A plug-in appears
 * - A plug-in is removed (not needed, but might be nice for control freaks...)
 * Complicated events that cause graph-recomputing (and other things)
 * - Verse data arrives
 *    Update Verse data model
 *    Is the addressed node monitored by any graphs? Then recompute them!
 * - Method call
 *    Module create/destroy: update XML, possibly remove (on destroy) monitoring.
 *    Input set: recompute affected graph.
