This directory contains sample "snapshots" of the kind of data parsed and
made interactive by Puyo.

The files are:

plugins.xml
	Contains the PurpleMeta/plugins buffer, listing all known plug-ins
	and their input types etc. This information is used to build the
	menu of plug-ins that can be instantiated, and also the UI of each
	such instance.

graphs.xml
	Contains the PurpleMeta/graphs buffer. This lists all the graphs
	that Purple knew about at the time the snapshot was made.

purpletest.xml
	Contains the (user-owned) purpletest text node, holding a single
	graph ("graph0"). This is what changes as the graph is edited by
	Puyo. Puyo must react to changes here from the outside, it never
	writes the buffer directly.

Note that these were all saved out from the Verse server where they would
normally reside during Purple operations; none of these are saved to disk
otherwise.
